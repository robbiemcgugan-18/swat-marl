"""
Hub implementation. 

No dedicated Controller class.
Only one callback function that is called once during ConnectionUp
that instructs all the switches to flood every packet to every port 
except the one whose the packet was coming from.

Notice that this is the simplest example of a proactive(static) configuration.

Prereq:
        study events.py

Learn: 
    pox uses OpenFlow v1.0 protocol (eg: of_flow_mod insted of of_flow_add)
    what is the launch function
    what is an action
    how to subscribe to an event setting a callback (handler) function
    what is _handle_ConnectionUp event
